# VR-Experiment-Design
This prototype was developed for the experiment of my master thesis. I have created this vr project with unity engine, the plugin google Resonance Audio. This project has been created based on the gamification principle. The purpose of this experiment is: which type of sensory feedback can best support human memory. There are five sensory models. This program is executable. [latest release](https://github.com/MomoVCHH/VR-Experiment-Design/releases/latest)

Through this video you get a better understanding of the design in the experiment.
You need to use headphones.
