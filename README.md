# VR-Experiment-Design
This prototype was developed for thesis experiments. I created this vr project with unity engine and the Plugin google Resonance Audio. /releases/latest

This project is created based on the gamification principle. The purpose of this experiment is: which type of sensory feedback can best support human memory. There are five sensory models.
